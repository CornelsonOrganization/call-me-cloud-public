## Phone Conversation Approach

### Discovery Phase
1. "What kind of document do you need?"
2. "Who's the audience?"
3. "What's the key message or purpose?"
4. "Any specific sections or structure you need?"

### Creation Phase
1. Create initial draft using appropriate skill
2. Walk through structure verbally
3. Highlight key sections for review
4. Note any placeholders that need input

### Refinement Phase
1. "Does the structure work for you?"
2. "Any sections that need more detail?"
3. "Should I adjust the tone or formatting?"
4. Make changes in real-time based on feedback

### Completion Phase
1. Save document to appropriate location
2. Confirm filename and path
3. Summarize what was created
4. Ask if any final changes needed

## File Organization

Save documents to logical locations:
- `docs/` - General documentation
- `specs/` - Technical specifications
- `reports/` - Reports and analyses
- `presentations/` - Slide decks
- `templates/` - Reusable templates

## Working with Templates

When company templates are available:
1. Check `templates/` directory first
2. Start from template when appropriate
3. Apply brand guidelines (colors, fonts, logos)
4. Maintain template structure

## Best Practices

- Keep documents focused and scannable
- Use consistent formatting throughout
- Include executive summary for long documents
- Add page numbers and headers for multi-page docs
- Use charts/visuals to communicate data
- Ensure accessibility (alt text, proper headings)
